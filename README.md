ðŸ‘‹ Hello! The extension still in the early development phase.


**PHPTestSuite** provides integration for **PHPUnit** and **PEST**.

## Requirements

ðŸ’¡ In order to use this extension project must contain composer.json file with a PHPUnit or PEST installed.

## Usage

* Use PHPTestSuite sidebar (double click on the test inside a file will run it or use context menu to run a file)
- Open the command palette and type `PhpTestSuite`, `RunFile`, `RunNearest`, `RunLatest`, etc.

### Configuration
ðŸŽˆ There's no configuration at this point.

### Community
ðŸ‘‹ That's it! Hope you will enjoy using it!

P.S. Feel free to create issues, discussion, etc. ðŸ˜‰

### Roadmap
- [ ] Create a way to show that test is running
- [x] Add shortcuts
- [x] Show success or error icon right next to each test in the sidebar
- [x] Run a single test in file from the command palette 
- [x] Support different projects architecture (DDD, Modules, etcâ€¦)
- [x] Better tests filtering, right now thereâ€™s known issues with a regex
- [ ] Better folding in the sidebar
