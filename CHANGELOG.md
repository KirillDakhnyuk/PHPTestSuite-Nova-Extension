## Version 0.0.5
Fixed an issue with displaying non-test classes in the sidebar.

## Version 0.0.4
* Updated the info modal to only be 2000 chars long to avoid modal window overlap. This is probably a bug in Nova (reported).

* Add ability to run latest test from Command Palette and with a shortcut â€” `option-command-l`

## Version 0.0.2
* Add ability to run a single test from Command Palette
* Add shortcuts (`option-command-t` to run a file and `option-command-m` to run a single test method)
